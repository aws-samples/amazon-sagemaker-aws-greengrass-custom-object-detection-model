    "Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes in an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where an object of interest is, along with identifying what object the box encapsulates. But before we have this solution, we need to process a traning dataset, create and setup a training job for the alorithm so that the aglorithm can learn about the dataset and then host the algorithm as an endpoint, to which we can supply the query image.\n",

    "This notebook assumes you already have prepared two [Augmented Manifest Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/augmented-manifest.html) as training and validation input data for the object detection model.  \n",

    "There are many advantages to using **augmented manifest files** for your training input\n",

    "* No format conversion is required if you are using SageMaker Ground Truth to generate the data labels\n",
    "* Unlike the traditional approach of providing paths to the input images separately from its labels, augmented manifest file already combines both into one entry for each input image, reducing complexity in algorithm code for matching each image with labels. (Read this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/easily-train-models-using-datasets-labeled-by-amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth/) for more explanation.) \n",
    "* When splitting your dataset for train/validation/test, you don't need to rearrange and re-upload image files to different s3 prefixes for train vs validation. Once you upload your image files to S3, you never need to move it again. You can just place pointers to these images in your augmented manifest file for training and validation. More on the train/validation data split in this post later. \n",
    "* When using augmented manifest file, the training input images is loaded on to the training instance in *Pipe mode,* which means the input data is streamed directly to the training algorithm while it is running (vs. File mode, where all input files need to be downloaded to disk before the training starts). This results in faster training performance and less disk resource utilization. Read more in this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-model-training-using-faster-pipe-mode-on-amazon-sagemaker/) on the benefits of pipe mode.\n"

    "The object detection algorithm at its core is the [Single-Shot Multi-Box detection algorithm (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).
